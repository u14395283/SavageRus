#VizARD
VizARD is an app which helps you visualize data from tables in 3D graphs.
It allows a user to take a picture of a data table and, within seconds, to display a graphical representation of that table.
The graph is displayed in Augmented Reality - projected onto a video feed of the table, on the screen of a mobile device.

VizARD is currently only available to Android devices, but an iOS version is in the pipeline.

#How To Install VizARD
At the time of writing, VizARD is only available as an APK which has to be manually installed.

The most recent builds can be found in the Releases.

In order to install a version, simply download the .apk file which you would like to install and run it in on your device.
On most Android devices, third-party installations are not permitted by default. In case it is not enabled on your device, navigate to your Settings menu, open the Applications tab and enable "Unknown sources".

#Using VizARD
This part is a piece of cake. Simply open the app, point at a table which you would like to have the VizARD analyze (make sure there is as little other information in the screen as possible and that the table has enough light on it)
and tap the red circle. Give it a second (usually around 3-7 seconds) and then aim the phone at the table to behold your brand new, flashy, 3D vizualisation.

- If our algorithm decided on the wrong type of graph for your data (which unfortunately happens), simply tap the red circle on the left, bottom, corner of the screen to edit the graphs properties.
- If there are errors in the data (Optical Character Recognition is still learning and still makes mi5t4kes) you can also edit the cells in the table individually from the edit menu.

#Enjoy!
